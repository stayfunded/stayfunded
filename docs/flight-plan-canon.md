# Flight Plan Canon (LOCKED)

## Canonical dependency (non-negotiable)

This document defines **Flight Plan framing** (why the product exists, what is paid vs public, tone rules).

It does **not** define Playbook content.

All Playbook definition, structure, and language is canonical in:
`/docs/core product model - Playbooks.md`

If anything in this document conflicts with the Playbooks canon, the Playbooks canon wins.


# StayFunded — Product Canon (LOCKED)

## What StayFunded Is

StayFunded is a phase-aware companion for prop firm traders.

It exists for one reason:

“The rules, limits, and incentives of prop firms change what ‘good trading’ means — and that meaning changes again as an account moves from discovery to payouts.”

Most traders ignore this.  
Prop firms rely on it.

StayFunded makes those changes explicit by mapping firm- and phase-specific Playbooks to the trader’s current account state — without telling them what trades to take.


## The Core Belief (Non-Negotiable)

Prop firm accounts cannot be traded like normal cash accounts.

They are artificial environments designed with:
- asymmetric risk
- hidden failure modes
- rules that punish otherwise “good” trading behavior

These pressures are:
- different across firms
- different across evaluation types
- different across phases of the same account

If a trader understands this and adapts, they survive.  
If they don’t, they churn evaluations.

StayFunded exists to help traders see the game they’re actually playing.


## Why This Is Not a Book

A book explains ideas.

StayFunded applies those ideas to a trader’s specific account state:
- which firm
- which evaluation
- which phase

The value is not the information alone.  
The value is the synthesis of that information at the moment it matters.

Static content teaches.  
StayFunded unlocks the right Playbooks at the right time.


## Why This Is Not Signals, Coaching, or a Course

StayFunded does not:
- give trade signals
- teach strategies
- claim edge or performance
- promise payouts

Instead, it answers different questions:

- Why does this rule exist?
- Why does it break traders?
- What kind of behavior does it quietly reward or punish?
- How should “good trading” be interpreted in this phase?

This keeps StayFunded compliant, durable, and honest.


## The Product at Its Core: Playbooks + Paths

The core product unit is the **Playbook**.

A **Playbook** is firm-specific and phase-specific. It explains:
- the phase objective
- the primary risk (what blows accounts)
- common failure modes
- professional posture / behavior
- what to ignore
- how the phase ends and what changes next

Playbooks are canonical and defined exclusively in:
`/docs/core product model - Playbooks.md`

A **Path** is the lifecycle container that sequences Playbooks across a firm’s account lifecycle.

A Path does not contain guidance itself.  
It determines which Playbooks are unlocked based on account state.

“Flight Plan” may remain as a user-facing label for the Path + current phase view, but the system is powered by **Playbooks + Paths + Account State**.


## What StayFunded Does in v1

In v1, StayFunded is phase-aware and account-state-driven.

For the trader’s current **firm + phase**, StayFunded unlocks the relevant **Playbook(s)** and surfaces:
- what success means in this phase
- what blows accounts in this phase
- the failure modes that quietly kill traders here
- what “professional behavior” looks like under these rules
- what to ignore
- how the phase ends and what changes next

The experience updates when the trader’s phase changes.

Daily check-ins or habit tracking may exist later, but are not required for v1.


## Why Traders Pay $49/Month

Traders don’t pay for content.

They pay to avoid:
- wasting evaluation fees
- blowing funded accounts
- repeating the same invisible mistakes

If a trader accepts:
“I cannot trade this account the same way I trade my own money”

Then StayFunded becomes non-optional.

Primary pricing is **$49/month**.  
A secondary option exists: **$199/year** (confidence option, not the default CTA).


## Public vs Paid (Philosophy)

StayFunded also functions as a public reference for the prop firm industry.

Public content explains:
- how firms differ
- why rules exist
- how the industry works

Paid access unlocks:
- synthesis
- phase mapping
- firm-specific Playbooks
- calculators that matter *now*

Information is free.  
Application is paid.


## What a Path Is Not

A Path is not:
- a course
- a checklist
- a strategy
- a prescriptive trading plan

A Path represents account state.

It determines which firm-specific, phase-specific Playbooks are unlocked.


## Tone & Language Rules (Locked)

StayFunded language must be:
- blunt
- clear
- human
- slightly adversarial

Avoid:
- academic jargon
- “smart-sounding” abstractions
- vague safety language

We are not neutral observers.  
We are on the trader’s side — without lying to them.


## Explicit Non-Goals (v1)

StayFunded will not:
- predict markets
- optimize strategies
- replace discipline
- integrate directly with prop firms
- ingest account data automatically
- shame traders for losses

It is a companion, not a crutch.


## Canon Status

This document is **LOCKED**.

It may only be changed if:
- the product direction explicitly changes, and
- the revision is intentional and documented

Future threads must treat this as read-only truth.
