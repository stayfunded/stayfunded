# Topstep Evaluation — Phase Roadmap

## Phase objective
- Pass the evaluation **without violating drawdown or consistency rules**.
- Survival and eligibility matter more than speed.

## What this phase rewards
- Low variance
- Controlled daily behavior
- Repeatability over aggression

## What this phase punishes
- Early profit spikes
- Overtrading
- Pressing after green days
- Ignoring drawdown mechanics

---

## Operating doctrine (read once)
- You are not trying to “finish quickly.”
- You are trying to **stay eligible every day**.
- If a rule tightens, your behavior must tighten with it.

---

## Weekly structure (default)
- Trade **3–4 days per week**
- Accept that **some days are no-trade days**
- Time pressure is artificial — survivability is real

---

## Daily decision filter
Before trading, confirm:
- Market direction is defined
- You are not trading to “protect” gains
- You are not trading because yesterday was red or green

If any answer is no → **do not trade**

---

## Known danger rules (evaluation)
- Trailing drawdown  
  → Early gains increase future failure risk  
  → See rule: trailing drawdown (evaluation)

---

## End-of-day check
- Did equity make a new high?
- Did behavior tighten after gains?
- Did you stop trading when conditions degraded?

Passing this phase is about **what you avoid**, not what you extract.
