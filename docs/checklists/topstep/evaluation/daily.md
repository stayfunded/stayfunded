# Topstep Evaluation — Daily Execution Checklist

## Before the session (decide if today is a trade day)

Confirm all of the following:

- Market direction is clearly defined
- I am not trading to:
  - Protect gains
  - Make back yesterday
  - Speed up the evaluation
- I am mentally willing to stop trading early if conditions degrade

If **any** answer is no → **Do not trade today**

---

## During the session (if trading)

- Trade smaller than maximum allowed size
- Avoid expanding risk after early profits
- Stop trading if:
  - A new equity high is made early
  - Emotional pressure increases
  - Conditions become unclear

Remember:
Early profits increase trailing drawdown pressure.

---

## After the session (required)

Answer honestly:

- Did equity make a new high today?
- Did I stop trading when conditions degraded?
- Did I avoid “using available drawdown”?

---

## End-of-day classification

Choose **one**:

- Today was a **good execution day**
- Today was a **rule-safe no-trade day**
- Today increased **future risk** (note why)

Completion matters more than PnL.
