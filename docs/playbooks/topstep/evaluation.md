# Topstep — Evaluation Playbook
<!-- firm: topstep -->
<!-- phase: evaluation -->

## What this playbook is
This playbook is an **account-operating guide** for the **Topstep Evaluation phase**.

Evaluation is not normal trading.
It is a **rules-based test** designed to eliminate traders through constraint pressure and normal variance.

You can attempt this phase without preparation.
Serious traders don’t — not because preparation guarantees an outcome, but because misunderstanding constraints is the most common cause of failure.

This playbook exists to make those constraints explicit.

## Phase objective
- Evaluation is **not** designed to test long-term profitability.
- It is designed to filter traders through:
  - tight drawdown mechanics,
  - limited error tolerance,
  - and time-compressed variance.
- The firm is effectively testing whether you can remain **eligible** long enough for probability to resolve.
- Passing is a consequence of **survival**, not aggression.

## Primary risk
- The primary risk in Evaluation is **unintentional rule violation** by otherwise competent traders.
- Most failures occur when traders:
  - misunderstand drawdown mechanics,
  - size too aggressively before any buffer exists,
  - or treat Evaluation as a speed challenge.
- You can trade “well” and still fail if you trigger constraint mechanisms early.

## Rules doing the real damage in this phase
These rules interact to create the majority of Evaluation failures:

- [Trailing drawdown (unrealized)](/rules/trailing-drawdown)
- [Daily loss limit](/rules/daily-loss-limit)
- [Scaling and contract limits](/rules/scaling-and-contract-limits)
- [Max contracts relative to drawdown](/rules/scaling-and-contract-limits)

Do not rely on summaries.  
Confirm **how each rule is enforced**, not just how it is described.

## Common failure modes
- Trading maximum size immediately before any drawdown buffer exists
- Triggering drawdown early and changing behavior out of frustration or fear
- Overtrading after a small loss to get back to even
- Treating daily PnL as progress instead of continued eligibility
- Forgetting that unrealized PnL can still affect drawdown logic

## Professional posture / behavior
Professional posture in Evaluation is **defensive and restrained**.

Surviving behavior prioritizes **eligibility over opportunity**:
- Trading smaller than maximum size early
- Limiting trade frequency to reduce variance exposure
- Accepting missed opportunity as a cost of survival
- Avoiding any behavior whose purpose is “making it back”

If your approach requires volatility, speed, or frequent trades to prove itself quickly, it structurally feeds the firm’s edge in this phase.

## What to ignore
- Speed-to-pass narratives
- Leaderboards and social proof
- Aggressive Evaluation advice
- Short-term performance comparisons
- Any framing that treats Evaluation as a race instead of a filter

## Phase exit and what changes next
- This phase ends when the profit target is reached **without rule violation**.
- The behavior that passes Evaluation is intentionally constrained because the rules punish early variance.
- The next phase (Stabilization) changes incentives and constraints.
- A common failure is carrying Evaluation urgency into the next phase, where it becomes counterproductive.
