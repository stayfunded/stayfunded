# Topstep — Stabilization Playbook

## Phase objective
- Keep the account alive and stable while continuing consistent execution.
- Reduce variance: fewer bad days, fewer emotional spirals, fewer rule violations.
- Convert “I can trade” into “I can trade like this every week.”

## Primary risk
- Giving back progress with one sloppy day: overtrading, oversizing, or revenge trading.
- Expanding risk because you feel “safe now.”
- Losing discipline once the initial urgency fades.

## Rules doing the real damage in this phase
- [Trailing drawdown behavior after buffer](/rules/trailing-drawdown?firm=topstep&phase=stabilization)
- [Scaling rules](/rules/scaling-and-contract-limits?firm=topstep&phase=stabilization)
- [Daily loss limits during consolidation](/rules/daily-loss-limit?firm=topstep&phase=stabilization)

## Common failure modes
- Increasing size after a win streak (“I’ve earned it”).
- Moving stops, widening risk, or “hoping” a loser comes back.
- Taking second/third-rate setups because “it’s been quiet.”
- Trading outside your best window because you want more opportunity.
- Slipping into random discretionary trades that aren’t in the playbook.

## Professional posture / behavior
- Boring is the goal. Boring = stability.
- Risk stays capped even when confidence is high.
- Daily limits are treated like hard walls:
  - Max loss = done.
  - Max trades = done.
  - If you break your own rule once, you stop trading immediately.
- You trade your A+ setups only. If none show up, you do nothing.
- Review at end of day:
  - Did you follow the playbook? Yes/No.
  - If no, what exact rule broke?

## What to ignore
- “I’m close to the next milestone so I should push.”
- Social feeds, chat rooms, and other people’s trade ideas.
- The need to be active every day.
- Any setup you can’t label as one of your 1–3 approved setups.

## Phase exit + what changes next
- Exit Stabilization when:
  - You can string together consistent, rule-clean weeks.
  - Your worst days are smaller, and your blow-up days are gone.
  - Your process is stable enough that a payout attempt won’t cause you to deviate.
- Next phase (Payout) increases the temptation to force trades; the playbook gets even more restrictive and “profit-protective.”
