# Topstep — Discovery Playbook

## Phase objective
- Prove you can follow a simple process for multiple sessions without “creative trading.”
- Establish whether you have a repeatable edge *at all* under firm-style rules (not “in theory”).
- Build a tiny set of allowed setups you can execute on command.

## Primary risk
- Over-trading because you’re “not sure what works yet.”
- Strategy-hopping every time you take a normal loss.
- Turning Discovery into a PnL chase instead of a process validation.

## Rules doing the real damage in this phase
- [Trailing drawdown (account structure)](/rules/trailing-drawdown?firm=topstep&phase=discovery)
- [Daily loss limit](/rules/daily-loss-limit?firm=topstep&phase=discovery)
- [Profit target asymmetry](/rules/profit-target-asymmetry?firm=topstep&phase=discovery)
- [Time pressure / inactivity rules](/rules/time-pressure-and-inactivity?firm=topstep&phase=discovery)

## Common failure modes
- “Sampling” 12 different ideas in 1 week and calling it research.
- Changing rules mid-session (“just this once”) and corrupting your data.
- Trading outside your window (boredom trades, revenge trades).
- Oversizing to “see what the strategy can do.”
- Tracking nothing; relying on vibes and memory.

## Professional posture / behavior
- You are a lab tech, not a trader. Your job is to run controlled tests.
- One instrument, one session window, one playbook of setups.
- Hard stop for the day when you hit your max loss or max trades—no negotiation.
- Write down every trade before you place it (setup name + invalidation + target).
- If you can’t explain the trade in one sentence, you don’t take it.

## What to ignore
- “Making it back today.”
- New indicators, new Discord calls, new YouTube strategies.
- PnL spikes—positive or negative—unless they came from clean execution.
- Opinions about where price “should” go.

## Phase exit + what changes next
- Exit Discovery when you can show:
  - A small set of setups (1–3) you can execute consistently.
  - Clean rule adherence for multiple sessions (not one lucky day).
  - You know your personal failure pattern (overtrade, early entry, moving stops, etc.).
- Next phase (Evaluation) shifts from “can you follow a process?” to “can you protect the account while executing the process under pressure?”
