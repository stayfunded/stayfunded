# Topstep — Maintenance Playbook

## Phase objective
- Operate the account as a professional: consistent execution, controlled risk, repeatable payouts.
- Preserve longevity: minimize drawdowns, avoid rule pressure, keep your process boring.
- Build a sustainable routine you can repeat for months.

## Primary risk
- Lifestyle creep in risk: gradually increasing size, frequency, or sloppiness over time.
- Getting bored and inventing new ways to lose money.
- “Proving something” after a slow period.

## Rules doing the real damage in this phase
- [Trailing drawdown drift](/rules/trailing-drawdown?firm=topstep&phase=maintenance)
- [Scaling creep](/rules/scaling-and-contract-limits?firm=topstep&phase=maintenance)
- [Rule changes / silent parameter shifts](/rules/time-pressure-and-inactivity?firm=topstep&phase=maintenance)

## Common failure modes
- Adding new setups without a controlled test period.
- Trading more markets/timeframes because “I want more opportunity.”
- Ignoring recovery rules after a drawdown day.
- Turning green days into bigger green days (and then bigger red days).
- Drifting away from your original edge.

## Professional posture / behavior
- Maintenance is about consistency:
  - Same window.
  - Same setups.
  - Same risk model.
- Use a weekly operating plan:
  - Max red days per week.
  - Max loss per day.
  - Max trades per day.
- If you have a rule-break day, you take the next session off (automatic penalty).
- Run a monthly “audit”:
  - Are results coming from the approved setups?
  - Are you still following the rules?
  - What’s the #1 leak to eliminate next month?

## What to ignore
- Novelty for novelty’s sake.
- “Scaling fast.”
- Other traders’ PnL screenshots and challenge talk.
- Any urge to trade outside your system because you feel “comfortable.”

## Phase exit + what changes next
- Maintenance doesn’t “end” in v0.
- The only “change next” is deliberate scaling:
  - Scale only after a long period of rule-clean consistency.
  - Scale in small increments with a fixed evaluation period.
- If you can’t keep it boring, you’re not ready to scale.
