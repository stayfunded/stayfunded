# Topstep — Payout Playbook

## Phase objective
- Protect eligibility and avoid unforced errors while you convert performance into a payout.
- Reduce risk-taking and trade frequency to preserve the account.
- Treat every session as “do not lose the right to withdraw.”

## Primary risk
- Forcing trades to “finish the payout requirement.”
- Taking marginal setups because the goal feels close.
- Letting payout emotions override discipline (greed, impatience, fear).

## Rules doing the real damage in this phase
- [Trailing drawdown during withdrawal window](/rules/trailing-drawdown?firm=topstep&phase=payout)
- [Consistency / payout eligibility rules](/rules/time-pressure-and-inactivity?firm=topstep&phase=payout)
- [Daily loss limits near payout](/rules/daily-loss-limit?firm=topstep&phase=payout)

## Common failure modes
- Chasing early in the session to “get it done.”
- Oversizing because “one good trade can finish it.”
- Holding losers longer because “I can’t take a red day right now.”
- Trading after hitting a daily goal (“I’m hot”) and giving it back.
- Breaking your stop rules due to payout pressure.

## Professional posture / behavior
- In payout mode, you trade smaller and less.
- Only take your cleanest setup(s). If your A+ setup doesn’t appear, you do nothing.
- Define your daily “stop green” number:
  - If you hit it, you stop trading immediately.
- Keep your day short. Avoid late-session chop.
- Your priority order is:
  1) No rule breaks
  2) No big red days
  3) Slow, steady gains

## What to ignore
- “I’m behind schedule.”
- “I just need one trade.”
- Any non-playbook setup, even if it looks “good enough.”
- The urge to “maximize” the day.

## Phase exit + what changes next
- Exit Payout after:
  - You complete the payout process while staying rule-clean.
  - You can describe exactly what you did to reduce risk/variance during payout attempts.
- Next phase (Maintenance) becomes a long-term operating mode: consistent withdrawals require boring consistency, not hero days.
