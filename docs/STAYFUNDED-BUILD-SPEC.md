# StayFunded — Build Spec (Canonical)

This document is the single source of truth for what StayFunded IS, IS NOT, and how the product and public site must be built.

This spec replaces prior blueprints and discussions as the execution authority for building.

---

## PRODUCT DEFINITION

StayFunded is an execution framework delivered as an ongoing membership for prop-firm traders.

The membership provides a persistent operating environment that helps traders execute a real trade plan under prop-firm constraints, phase-aware, with structure and accountability over time.

StayFunded does NOT teach strategy.
StayFunded does NOT provide signals or trade calls.
StayFunded does NOT promise profits or outcomes.

StayFunded complements existing strategies and teachers; it does not replace them.

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO STRATEGIES & EDUCATORS (LOCKED)

StayFunded does not replace a trader’s strategy, educator, or “guru.”
Traders should bring their own strategy and keep their existing education.

StayFunded exists to solve what most education does not:
the execution intangibles under prop-firm constraints.

These intangibles include:
- rule-bending rationalization
- discipline decay over time
- size creep after wins
- hesitation after losses
- revenge impulses near limits
- phase blindness (evaluation vs funded vs payout behavior)
- “just one more trade” spirals
- emotional carryover day-to-day
- trading alone with no enforcement

StayFunded helps traders address these either:
- before they learn the lessons the hard way, or
- after they already learned them and want a framework that prevents repeat failures.

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM

Most prop-firm traders fail not because their strategy is bad, but because execution breaks under real constraints.

Common failure causes:
- rule violations under pressure
- trading the same way across incompatible phases
- gradual drift and rationalization
- isolation and lack of enforcement
- “just one more trade” spirals near limits

Prop-firm rules punish small lapses quickly.
Execution fails before strategy does.

---

## THE SOLUTION: THE FRAMEWORK (MEMBERSHIP)

The StayFunded Framework governs HOW a trader executes, not WHAT they trade.

It is accessed as an ongoing membership that a trader operates inside while running prop-firm accounts.

Users do not “complete” the Framework.
They remain inside it while operating prop-firm accounts.

---

## FRAMEWORK PILLARS

### 1) Today
The daily operating surface.

Purpose:
- decide whether today is a go / no-go trading day
- define explicit risk limits and stop conditions
- enforce phase-correct behavior
- prevent unforced errors before trades occur

Today is about restraint, not opportunity.

---

### 2) Playbooks
Firm-specific and phase-specific execution guidance.

Purpose:
- explain how rules interact with behavior
- surface common failure modes
- clarify what matters in the current phase
- show what to prioritize and what to avoid

Playbooks change expectations across:
- evaluation
- funded
- payout
- maintenance phases

---

### 3) Accountability
Visibility and enforcement when execution matters most.

Principles:
- accountability is operational, not motivational
- a committed trade plan is required
- execution becomes visible to another person
- enforcement changes behavior without coaching or signals

Constraints:
- pairing is account-level
- only one account (or copy-trading group) can be paired at a time
- accountability exists within the membership context

---

## FRAMEWORK AS A MEMBERSHIP (CLARIFICATION)

The Framework is not a tool, course, or one-time purchase.

The membership exists to:
- provide continuous execution structure across phases
- reinforce correct behavior over time
- act as a backstop against drift and isolation
- allow accountability to be invoked when needed

Language should emphasize:
- operating inside the Framework
- remaining inside the Framework
- Framework membership

Avoid framing that suggests completion or one-off usage.

---

## RECOVERY (OPTIONAL ADD-ON)

Recovery is a paid, optional, time-boxed add-on to the StayFunded membership.

Purpose:
- intervene when execution is breaking
- provide higher-touch accountability temporarily
- reset behavior before an account is lost

Recovery characteristics:
- 30-day reset
- explicit structure reinforcement
- temporary by design

Recovery is NOT:
- therapy
- coaching
- signals
- a permanent crutch
- the core product

Pricing:
- $299 first month
- $99/month starting month two
- requires active StayFunded membership

Constraints:
- recovery is applied at the account level
- only one account can be in recovery at a time

---

## STRATEGY ANALYSIS (TOP-OF-FUNNEL)

Strategy Analysis is free.

Purpose:
- diagnose how a trader’s current approach fails inside prop-firm rules
- surface rule friction and execution breakdowns
- prevent premature strategy-hopping

It does NOT:
- rank strategies
- evaluate edge quality
- provide trade ideas or setups

If strategy viability exists but execution breaks, the Framework is the solution.

---

## SITE JOB

The public site must:

1) Explain what StayFunded is in under two minutes
2) Filter out signal-seekers and community-seekers
3) Orient serious traders around execution, rules, and phases
4) Funnel users into:
   - Strategy Analysis (free)
   - Then the Framework membership
   - With Recovery positioned as an optional escalation

---

## NAVIGATION (LOCKED)

Top-level navigation must be:

- Framework
- Recovery
- Strategy Analysis
- Pricing
- Why

No additional top-level items.

Discovery is deprecated for now and should not be emphasized.

---

## FOUNDER STORY (“WHY”)

The founder story exists to establish credibility and origin, not hype.

Core themes:
- technical competence and autonomy
- working strategies that still failed
- isolation and rule-breaking spiral
- insight: plans work; execution breaks
- StayFunded as the missing backstop

Tone:
- grounded
- matter-of-fact
- no hero narrative
- no motivational language

---

## GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS

- no signals
- no trade calls
- no guarantees
- no community framing
- no leaderboards
- no gamification
- frame StayFunded as a membership, not a one-off product

---

## CHANGE PROCESS

When product or positioning decisions change:
- update this document
- treat this document as authoritative
- do not rely on chat memory or prior blueprints
