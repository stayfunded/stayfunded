# Trailing drawdown
<!-- ruleSlug: trailing-drawdown -->
<!-- category: drawdown-mechanics -->

## Definition
- Trailing drawdown is **not** a static maximum loss.
- It is a **moving risk boundary** that tightens as your account makes money.
- Once it tightens, it **never loosens**, even if profits are given back.

## Mechanics & math
- The drawdown threshold moves upward when account equity reaches new highs.
- Depending on firm implementation, it may trail:
  - Realized PnL only, or
  - Realized + unrealized PnL.
- The practical effect is asymmetric:
  - Upside tightens constraints.
  - Downside is permanent.

## Why firms use it
- It converts **normal variance** into disqualification risk.
- It penalizes early volatility more than late consistency.
- It rewards slow, linear equity curves over fast gains.

## Common trader misbeliefs
- “If I’m green, I’m safe.”
- “Drawdown only matters on losing days.”
- “I can trade bigger early, then slow down.”
- “I’ll just size down later if it tightens.”

## How traders get hurt
- Early profit spikes tighten drawdown prematurely.
- A later, statistically normal red day violates the account.
- Traders respond by:
  - Forcing trades,
  - Avoiding valid setups,
  - Or revenge-trading to ‘stay ahead’ of the line.

## Phase interaction
- **Evaluation phase is the most dangerous context** for trailing drawdown.
- In evaluation:
  - There is no buffer.
  - Every dollar earned immediately increases risk.
  - The account is most fragile when it appears to be “going well.”
- The same rule becomes less dangerous once:
  - A buffer exists, or
  - Incentives shift away from speed.

## How to trade against it (locked)
- Operate with the assumption that **survival matters more than speed**.
- Avoid large early equity swings.
- Favor repeatable, lower-variance execution over “good days.”
- Treat early profits as **risk taken**, not safety earned.
