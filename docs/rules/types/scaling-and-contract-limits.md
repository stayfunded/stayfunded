# Scaling and contract limits
<!-- ruleSlug: scaling-and-contract-limits -->
<!-- category: sizing -->

## Definition
- Traders think size limits are “just a cap.”
- They are part of the firm’s variance control system and often interact with drawdown in non-obvious ways.

## Mechanics & math
- Size increases increase variance and drawdown pressure non-linearly.
- The risk is not “too big once,” it’s repeated exposure while constraints tighten.

## Why firms use it
- It nudges traders into self-elimination through volatility and impatience.
- It prevents the firm from being exposed to outsized intraday variance.

## Common trader misbeliefs
- “If I’m confident, I should size up.”
- “I need size to make progress.”
- “I can scale up early and scale down later.”

## How traders get hurt
- Scaling early before buffer exists triggers drawdown and psychological instability.
- Traders oscillate size in response to emotions.

## Phase interaction
- Evaluation punishes early scaling the most.
- Stabilization and Maintenance punish slow drift into higher variance.
