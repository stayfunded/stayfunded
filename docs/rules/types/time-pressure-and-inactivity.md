# Time pressure and inactivity rules
<!-- ruleSlug: time-pressure-and-inactivity -->
<!-- category: time-constraints -->

## Definition
- Traders think time rules are “admin.”
- They change incentives and push traders into low-quality trades to avoid inactivity penalties or deadline pressure.

## Mechanics & math
- Time constraints compress decision-making and increase trade frequency.
- More trades under pressure increases variance and error rate.

## Why firms use it
- It increases participation (and therefore errors) without touching the trader’s strategy directly.

## Common trader misbeliefs
- “I must trade today.”
- “I should force something small.”
- “This doesn’t affect performance.”

## How traders get hurt
- Forced participation produces rule violations via overtrading.
- Deadlines change behavior near the end of a window.

## Phase interaction
- Discovery: determines account hostility for your lifestyle.
- Payout: increases forcing behavior when withdrawals feel close.
