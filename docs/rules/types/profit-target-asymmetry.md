# Profit target asymmetry
<!-- ruleSlug: profit-target-asymmetry -->
<!-- category: incentives -->

## Definition
- Traders think the profit target is “the goal.”
- It’s a structural asymmetry: the effort to reach the target is large, but the penalty for variance is immediate.

## Mechanics & math
- If drawdown constraints are tight relative to target, the account is mathematically hostile to normal variance.
- Traders are pressured into higher variance behavior to “finish.”

## Why firms use it
- It creates a natural impatience trap and increases elimination without banning “good” traders.

## Common trader misbeliefs
- “I just need a few good days.”
- “More trades means faster progress.”
- “I’ll scale up once I’m close.”

## How traders get hurt
- Traders change behavior near the finish line and violate rules.
- The account becomes hardest when they feel closest.

## Phase interaction
- This dynamic is strongest in Discovery (selection) and Evaluation (execution under pressure).
