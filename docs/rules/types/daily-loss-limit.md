# Daily loss limit
<!-- ruleSlug: daily-loss-limit -->
<!-- category: daily-constraints -->

## Definition
- Traders think it’s “a daily stop.”
- It’s a hard constraint that interacts with behavior (revenge trading, overtrading) and can end the day or the account depending on implementation.

## Mechanics & math
- A daily limit converts one bad decision into a forced outcome: you lose the right to keep operating that day.
- The danger is not the limit itself; it’s the behavior it triggers.

## Why firms use it
- It caps runaway losses for the firm while amplifying trader failure modes under stress.

## Common trader misbeliefs
- “I can make it back today.”
- “One more trade fixes it.”
- “If I reduce size, I can ignore the limit.”

## How traders get hurt
- Small loss → urgency → trade frequency increases → limit hit.
- Late-session “get back to even” spirals.

## Phase interaction
- Evaluation and payout windows amplify the psychological pressure of this rule.
