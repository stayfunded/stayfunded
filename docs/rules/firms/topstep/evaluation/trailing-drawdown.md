# Trailing drawdown — Evaluation phase
<!-- ruleSlug: trailing-drawdown -->

## Phase interaction
- In Topstep evaluations, trailing drawdown is the **primary failure mechanism**.
- The account is most fragile immediately after early gains.
- Passing quickly increases disqualification risk more than trading slowly.

## How to trade against it (locked)
- Treat the first profitable days as **risk creation**, not progress.
- Cap daily variance intentionally, even if allowed room exists.
- Prefer stopping early over “using available drawdown.”
- If equity reaches a new high early in the session, reduce exposure or stop.
