## Purpose
- Make the Framework membership the primary product.
- Make Recovery a paid add-on layer (optional escalation).

- Secondary funnel: Recovery (30-day reset) as escalation.

## Global constraints
- No signals, no trade calls, no guarantees.
- No community framing.
- Do not imply we replace strategies/teachers/gurus.
- Keep tone grounded, consequence-focused.

## HERO

### Headline
You don’t need a new strategy.  
You need a framework membership that keeps you executing the one you already have.

### Subhead
Most traders already have an edge. What they don’t have is structure, a real trade plan, and anyone watching them execute it. StayFunded exists to make execution real — inside prop firm rules.

### CTA buttons
Primary: See the Framework  
Secondary: On your last leg? Try Recovery (30-day reset)

### Trust line (small)
Bring your own strategy. Keep your educator. No signals. No promises.

## SECTION: THE MISSING PART OF TRADING

### Header
The hardest parts of trading aren’t taught — they’re exposed.

### Body
Every trader hears about discipline, fear, and greed. Very few actually train them.

Because trading is solitary. No one sees you bend rules. No one stops “just this once.”  
And prop firm rules punish small lapses fast.

StayFunded is built to tackle the intangibles veterans talk about — by structure and visibility, inside a membership you operate within over time.

### Intangibles list (bullets)
- rule-bending rationalization  
- discipline decay over time  
- size creep after wins  
- hesitation after losses  
- revenge impulses near limits  
- phase blindness (evaluation vs funded vs payout behavior)  
- “just one more trade” spirals  
- emotional carryover day-to-day  
- trading alone with no enforcement

## SECTION: YOU ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION

### Header
If you need StayFunded, you’re not broken. You’re normal.

### Bullets
- blown more than one prop firm account  
- traded well in theory but failed live  
- broken rules you knew you shouldn’t  
- drifted and felt embarrassed admitting it  

### Close
You’re not alone. You’re the majority.  
StayFunded is the missing wedge between knowing what to do — and actually doing it.

## SECTION: FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### Header
The StayFunded Framework membership

### Intro
StayFunded doesn’t replace your strategy or teacher. It gives them a place to actually work.

### Pillars (3)
**Today** — What matters right now for your specific prop firm account and phase. No noise.  
**Playbooks** — How behavior must change across phases — and why traders fail even when profitable.  
**Accountability** — Your trade plan is explicit and committed. You don’t trade on an island anymore.

## SECTION: ACCOUNTABILITY (CALLOUT)

### Header
Accountability changes behavior. Everyone knows this.

### Body
You trade differently when someone can see the plan you committed to, the rules you agreed to follow, and the account you’re operating.

StayFunded makes execution visible — without signals, policing, or gurus.

---

## SECTION: RECOVERY (INTRO)

### Header
Recovery: a 30-day reset when execution breaks

### Body
Recovery is for traders who know their strategy works but keep breaking rules and are close to giving up.

It adds higher-touch accountability and structure — temporarily.  
Recovery isn’t permanent. It’s a way back.

### CTA

## SECTION: FOUNDER TEASER

### Body
StayFunded exists because I needed it — and it didn’t exist.  
I had a strategy. I understood markets. I still lost everything by trading alone and breaking my own rules.

### CTA

## FOOTER CTA (FINAL ANCHOR)

### Header
Start with clarity.

Run the free Strategy Analysis to see where your approach quietly breaks under prop firm rules.  
If the strategy is viable but execution breaks, that’s what the Framework membership is built to fix.
