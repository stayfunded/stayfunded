# Page Spec — Framework (/framework)

## Purpose
- Position the Framework as the core membership product.
- Make explicit: bring your own strategy, keep your educator; StayFunded governs execution.
- Describe the three pillars: Today, Playbooks, Accountability.
- Clarify what StayFunded is / isn’t (no signals, no coaching, no community).
- Set expectations: phase-aware, rule-aware, execution-focused.

## Global constraints
- No signals, no trade calls, no guarantees.
- No community framing.
- Do not imply we replace strategies/teachers/gurus.

## HERO

### Title
The StayFunded Framework

### Subhead
A membership system for executing your trade plan inside prop firm constraints — without trading alone.

### This is / isn’t (must include)
**This is:** execution structure, phase-aware operating system, accountability visibility.  
**This isn’t:** signals, coaching, strategy education, community, leaderboards.

### Anchor line (explicit positioning)
StayFunded does not tell you what to trade. It helps you execute what you already believe — consistently.

## SECTION: TODAY

### Header
Today

### Body
What matters right now for your specific prop firm account and phase. No noise.

Today is designed to prevent unforced errors before they happen:
- go / no-go decisions
- explicit risk limits
- stop conditions
- phase-correct behavior

---

## SECTION: PLAYBOOKS

### Header
Playbooks

### Body
How behavior must change across phases — and why traders fail even when profitable.

Playbooks exist because:
- evaluation behavior is not funded behavior
- payout behavior is not maintenance behavior
- rules punish the wrong behavior fast

Playbooks emphasize:
- what to prioritize right now
- what to avoid in this phase
- the common “gotchas” that quietly blow accounts

---

## SECTION: ACCOUNTABILITY

### Header
Accountability

### Core copy
Accountability isn’t motivation. It’s visibility.

Each account has a committed trade plan. You can opt into pairing at the account level when you need it.

StayFunded does not police you. It makes execution visible so drift is harder.

### Constraints (must include)
- Pairing is account-level.
- Only one account (or copy-trading group) can be paired at a time.
- A detailed trade plan is required for any account marked accountability.

## CLOSE

### Closing statement
Strategy answers what. StayFunded governs how. Together, they work.
