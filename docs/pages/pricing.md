# Page Spec — Pricing (/pricing)

## Purpose
- Keep existing membership tiers as-is (do not rewrite tier names/prices).
- Add a clearly separated Recovery add-on block:
  - Recovery is an add-on, requires membership.
  - $299 month one, then $99/month from month two.
  - Cancel anytime.

## Constraints
- Do not change existing tier structure, CTA wiring, or Stripe behavior yet.
- Add-on block is informational + links to Recovery page for now.

---

## REQUIRED CHANGE
Add a new section on the pricing page:

### Header
Recovery add-on

### Body
Recovery is a time-boxed, 30-day reset layer for Framework members who are close to washing out and need higher-touch structure temporarily.

### Pricing line
$299 for month one, then $99/month starting month two. Cancel anytime. Requires active Framework membership.

### CTA
Learn about Recovery -> /recovery
