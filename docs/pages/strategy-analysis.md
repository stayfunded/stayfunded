# Page Spec — Strategy Analysis (/strategy-analysis)

## Purpose
- Free top-of-funnel.
- Diagnose how a trader’s current strategy/approach fails inside prop-firm rules.
- Explicitly: no rankings, no signals, no promises, no market analysis.
- Bridge to the Framework membership when execution breaks.

## Global constraints
- No signals, no trade calls, no guarantees.
- Do not imply we evaluate edge quality or provide strategy advice.
- Do not imply we replace educators/gurus.

## HERO

### Title
Strategy Analysis (Free)

### Subhead
Before you change strategies, understand how your current one actually fails inside prop firm rules.

---

## BODY

### Core paragraph
Most traders abandon strategies too early. The failure is often rule friction and execution breakdowns — not the edge itself.

### Disclaimers (must include)
- No rankings.
- No signals.
- No promises.
- No market analysis.
- Rule friction and execution clarity only.

### Bridge paragraph (must include)
If the analysis shows the strategy is viable but execution breaks, that’s what the StayFunded Framework membership is built for.
