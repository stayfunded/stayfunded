# Change Spec — Terminology alignment (public pages)

## Goal
Public marketing language should consistently position:
- Core = "Framework membership"
- Recovery = "add-on" requiring membership
- Avoid calling StayFunded a "daily operating system" on public pages

## Required edits
1) src/app/pricing/page.tsx
- Update metadata title/description/openGraph to use "Framework membership" language.
- Update the header paragraph(s) that say "daily operating system" to "framework membership" (keep the meaning).
- Keep outcome framing (no promises).

## Constraints
- Do not change pricing, buttons, or layout.
- Only copy/metadata edits.
