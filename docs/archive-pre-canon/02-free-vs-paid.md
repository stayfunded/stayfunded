# 02 — Free vs Paid Access (Conversion Logic)

## V0 Access Model (LOCKED FOR BUILD)
Goal: make the product feel useful for free, and undeniable when paid.

### Free
- Access to:
  - Firm picker (`/firms`)
  - Firm hub pages (`/firms/[firm]`)
  - Rules + Strategy pages (read-only)
  - News calendar page (view-only placeholder in v0)
  - AI Lab page (view-only placeholder + tick data explanation)

### Paid (v0)
- Access to:
  - Calculators (interactive)
  - Bias Console (interactive)
  - Checklists (interactive)
  - Email notifications for high-impact news (later in v0+)

Notes:
- We will implement gating after calculators are real.
- Until gating exists, pages may show a “Paid feature” banner (non-blocking).


This document defines **what is free, what is paid, and why the upgrade feels obvious**.

StayFunded does not sell “more content.”
It sells **clarity inside expensive constraints**.

Traders are already spending real money on evaluations.
The paid tier exists to protect that spend.

---

## Core Principle

Free users should:
- immediately understand what StayFunded is
- feel smarter than before
- see clear value
- feel *slightly constrained*

Paid users should:
- feel calmer
- trade with confidence
- stop guessing
- feel like $149 is cheap insurance

## Paid Tier ($149 Target)

This tier exists to answer:
> “How do I actually trade *this* firm without blowing up?”

### Paid Access Includes

#### Unlimited FirmProfiles
- Multiple firms
- Multiple account types per firm

This is the **insider knowledge** traders feel they never get.

---

### Strategy Fit (Full Playbook)
- Strategy style matrix
- Risk posture guidance
- Behavioral recommendations
- “Best path to pass” framing
- “Best path to survive funded” framing

No systems.
No signals.
Just strategic clarity.

---

### Calculators & Simulators

- “What breaks first” logic
- Saved defaults per firm

This is where rules become actionable.

---

---

### Session Bias Console

This is the “sexy” daily-use feature that keeps users coming back.

---

### News Alerts

- Firm-safe framing (“do you want to trade this?”)

---

### AI Lab (Full)
- Full tick data downloads
- Firm-contextual prompts
- Research questions for pattern discovery
- No trade advice, no predictions

This scratches the “AI curiosity” itch without liability.

---

## Why $149 Makes Sense

From the trader’s perspective:
- One failed evaluation costs more than StayFunded
- One saved funded account pays for it many times over
- The value compounds across firms and attempts

We are not selling hope.
We are selling **clarity, structure, and survivability**.

---

## Conversion Philosophy

We do NOT:
- shame free users
- hide everything
- use fake scarcity
- use hype language

We DO:
- show real insight
- let users feel the gap
- frame paid as protection, not upside
- let affiliates sell confidence, not promises

---

## Summary

Free users learn **what they’re dealing with**.
Paid users learn **how to operate inside it**.

That difference is worth $149.
