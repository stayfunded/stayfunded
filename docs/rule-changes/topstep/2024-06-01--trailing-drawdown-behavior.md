## What changed
- Enforcement clarity around how early profits tighten the trailing drawdown.
- Emphasis that drawdown behavior is affected by equity peaks, not just losses.

## Why it matters
- Early profit spikes permanently reduce survivability in evaluation.
- Traders attempting to “get ahead early” increase failure risk later in the phase.
