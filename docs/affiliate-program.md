StayFunded — Affiliate Program Blueprint (CANONICAL)

STATUS: CANONICAL
This document defines the complete affiliate system for StayFunded.
If there is a conflict between this document and any conversation, this document wins.

1. Purpose

The StayFunded affiliate program exists to:

• Make it extremely easy for partners to sell StayFunded
• Make it financially attractive to do so long-term
• Ensure affiliates explain StayFunded correctly
• Turn educators, traders, and communities into durable growth partners

Affiliates are treated as partners, not traffic sources.

2. Core Philosophy

Affiliates succeed when they explain one truth clearly:

Prop firm rules change what “good trading” means.

StayFunded helps traders adapt to those rules — from eval selection to payouts.

We optimize for:
• Recurring revenue
• Long-term trust
• Correct positioning

We explicitly do NOT optimize for:
• Coupon spam
• “Get rich” messaging
• Arbitrage abuse
• Misrepresentation

3. Who Can Be an Affiliate

Eligible:
• Individual traders
• Educators / coaches
• YouTubers / podcasters
• Discord & community owners
• Trading content sites

Approval is required but lightweight.

4. Attribution Model (Authoritative)
4.1 Referral Link

Each affiliate receives a unique referral link:

https://stayfunded.io/?ref=AFFILIATE_CODE

Rules:
• Cookie-based attribution
• Cookie duration: 30 days minimum
• Attribution persists across sessions

4.2 Signup Code

Each affiliate also receives a human-readable signup code:

AFFILIATE_CODE

Usage:
• Entered manually during signup
• Useful for YouTube, podcasts, Discord, screenshots

If both a referral link and a code are present:
• The signup code takes precedence

5. Commission Structure
5.1 Default Commission

• 30% recurring commission
• Applies to all paid plans
• Applies to renewals and upgrades

Commission duration:
• Lifetime of the subscription
• Or minimum 12 months (whichever is longer)

Any bonus must be documented here before launch.

• “StayFunded helps traders adapt to the account they’re trading.”

Affiliates MAY NOT say:
• Guaranteed profits
• Signals
• Insider access

11. Future Expansion (Not Required for v1)

These must not block v1.

12. Canonical Rule
