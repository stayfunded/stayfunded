# Codex Guardrails — StayFunded

Codex is operating on the StayFunded codebase. The following rules are non-negotiable.

## PRODUCT TRUTH (LOCKED)

- StayFunded is an execution framework for prop-firm traders.
- StayFunded does NOT teach strategy.
- StayFunded does NOT provide signals, trade calls, rankings, or profit promises.
- StayFunded complements existing strategies and teachers; it does not replace them.
- The core product is the Framework.
- Recovery is an optional, paid, time-boxed intervention layer — not the core product.
- Accountability is about visibility and enforcement, not motivation or community.

## POSITIONING RULES (LOCKED)

- Messaging must be Framework-first, not tools-first.
- Avoid hype, urgency, guarantees, or aspirational trading language.
- Avoid “daily OS” framing unless explicitly grounded in the Framework.
- Avoid community framing. Discord is operational pairing only.
- Strategy Analysis is a diagnostic top-of-funnel, not a signal generator.
- Discovery is deprecated for now and should not be emphasized.

## EXECUTION RULES

- Do not invent product features, flows, or pages.
- Do not change pricing, plans, or business rules unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not add new navigation items.
- Do not refactor code unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer full-file edits when rewriting pages.
- Preserve imports, component structure, and styling conventions unless instructed otherwise.

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

- The canonical product and site definition lives in:
  `docs/STAYFUNDED-BUILD-SPEC.md`
- If there is ambiguity, STOP and ask for clarification.
- Do not rely on memory or inference outside the spec.

Failure to follow these rules is considered an error.
